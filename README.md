## Last Updated: 08-10-2024

Welcome to Recipe Stages! This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you use our app. By using the app, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.

### Information We Collect
Personal Information:

Email Address: We collect your email address for user authentication purposes. This helps us verify your identity and ensure the security of your account.
Ad Data (via Google AdMob):

IP Address: Collected to estimate the general location of the device.
User Product Interactions: Collected to understand how users interact with the app, including app launches, taps, and video views.
Diagnostic Information: Collected to improve app and SDK performance, including crash logs, app launch time, hang rate, and energy usage.
Device and Account Identifiers: Collected to identify the device and any signed-in accounts, including the Android advertising ID and app set ID.
All user data collected by the Google Mobile Ads SDK is encrypted in transit using the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol.

### How We Use Your Data
We use the information we collect for the following purposes:

Authentication: To create and manage your account in the app and to prevent unauthorized access.
App Functionality: To ensure the app operates smoothly and securely for all users.
Ads and Analytics: To display personalized ads and to analyze how users interact with the app through third-party services such as Google AdMob and Google Analytics.
### Third-Party Services
We use the following third-party services, which may collect personal data as described in their own privacy policies:

Firebase (Google Cloud): Handles user authentication (via Firebase Auth) and data storage (via Firestore) for user-generated content like recipes.
Google AdMob: Displays advertisements and collects data to improve ad relevance and performance. For more information on how Google AdMob collects, uses, and shares data, please review the Google AdMob Privacy Policy.
### Data Storage and Retention
Your data is securely stored by Firebase:

User Account Information: Email, username, and password are stored securely via Firebase Auth and Firestore.
Recipes: Unshared recipes are stored locally on the device. Shared recipes are stored in Firebase for the community feed.
### Data Deletion
We allow users to delete their shared recipes and their entire account without leaving any data behind. When you delete your account, all your data, including shared recipes, will be permanently deleted. You can delete your account and data directly from the appâ€”there's no need to contact us for this process.

### Data Security
We take data security seriously and implement appropriate security measures, including:

Firebase Security: Firebase uses industry-standard security to protect your data. Only authenticated users can access their own data.
App Check: We use Firebase App Check to ensure that only legitimate users access the app.
### Children's Privacy
Our app does not target or intend to attract children under the age of 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal data from children under this age, we will take steps to delete that information.

### Changes to the Privacy Policy
We may update this privacy policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we will notify you via push notification within the app and include the changes in our release notes. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
